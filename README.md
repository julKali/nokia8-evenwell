# nokia8-evenwell
This repository contains decompilations of all packages from com.evenwell that I found on my Nokia 8

The packages have been directly pulled from my Nokia 8 (TA-1012) running Android 9 on the 21st of March 2019.

For each APK I have generated (I) an unzipped version, (II) a decompiled version, where DEX files were disassembled into Smali and their ressources extracted into human-readable form and finally (III) a version with just the dex files decompiled as JAVA code.

For each of these three variants there is a separate folder within the package folder. I believe the repository structure to be relatively self-explanatory.
