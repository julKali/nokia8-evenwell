However, HMD Global may enforce the third party Content license terms against you as a third party beneficiary of those terms. The third party Content providers are third-party beneficiaries under these Terms and may enforce the provisions that directly concern the Content in which they have rights. HMD Global may be acting as an agent for third party Content provider in providing the Content to you. HMD Global is not a party to the transaction between you and the third party Content provider for such Content. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>7. Allegations of Copyright Infringement&lt;/b> &lt;br/>HMD Global respects the intellectual property rights of third parties. If you wish to send a notice of intellectual property infringement, including claims of copyright infringement, please use our procedures for submitting Notices of Infringement.

If your Order involves a trial period (also known as try-and-buy), you may be charged when the trial period expires, unless you cancel in accordance with the subscription/trial terms. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>The prices in the Service may change from time to time. Prices include applicable taxes in effect at the time of your transaction, unless otherwise stated.
