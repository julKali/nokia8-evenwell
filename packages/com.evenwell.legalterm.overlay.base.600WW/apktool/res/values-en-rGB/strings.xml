HMD Global expressly disclaims any statements or guarantees regarding the availability of specific content or services.

HMD Global may make major changes to the service or software versions, or decide not to release a final version. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>15. Links to Third-Party Websites and Content&lt;/b> &lt;br/>HMD Global may provide access paths to other sites and services on its Internet or pre-downloaded client end; thereby allowing you to interact with sites and services owned or operated by third parties (such sites and services do not count as part of the services under these terms). Before using such sites and services, you must read and agree to the terms and conditions of these sites and services. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>HMD Global has no right to control third-party content, websites or services. For this reason, HMD Global undertakes no liability for the services provided or the materials created or published based on these third-party sites or services. A link to a particular third-party website by no means implies that HMD Global agrees with the site or the products or services mentioned therein. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>Additionally, you and other users may create relevant content and links to content contained in the services (without providing such content to the services described in these terms.) HMD Global undertakes no liability for content or links of this type. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>16. Advertising&lt;/b> &lt;br/>The services may include some adverts.

The invalid provisions should be replaced with valid provisions that are closest to the intention and goals of these terms. If one or several provisions of these terms are irrelevant to your use of the services, this does not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of the terms or of this article. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>In case of conflicts between HMD Global ‘s terms of service and its privacy policy, the application of these HMD Global terms of service should be given priority. After these terms have terminated, any terms that should remain valid after your registration is terminated shall continue to be valid. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>20.3 Changes to the Terms&lt;/b> &lt;br/>HMD Global may revise these terms at any time without any separate notification.
