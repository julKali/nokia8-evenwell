    <string name="privacy_statement_description_wlan">"InFocus emphasizes the protection of your privacy. To continuously improve the performance and stability of the software and hardware on the device, we sometimes need to collect your information contained in the device. In this Privacy Statement, we explain how we collect this information via the diagnosis mechanism and how we use it. This Privacy Statement is only applicable to information collected via the diagnosis mechanism. It is not applicable to information collected in other ways.

1. Information collection via the diagnosis mechanism
When the program, application or hardware of your device has an error, the diagnosis mechanism will create an error report. It incorporates the information of the device in the report and transmits it to us via modem connection or WLAN. If you select to transmit the report via modem connection, you may need to pay a connection fee. We will sort and analyze the collected information to determine the cause of the error. The result of the analysis will be used as a reference for improving the performance and stability of the software and hardware. The content of the error report may differ depending on the cause or property of the error. It may contain the following information:

Device name, hardware version, software version, Linux version, device serial number, total booting time, time of error occurrence, base station information, WLAN connection information, error log and user's personal information. The user's personal information may contain your phone number or e-mail address.

2. Information security
InFocus strictly protects your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from illegal access, use or disclosure. For example, your information is stored on a secure and reliable network and the server is installed at a place where entry and exit are strictly controlled. Only authorized personnel who need your information are allowed to access it. We will not sell your personal information to any third party for any purpose.

3. Disclaimer
InFocus does not assume any legal liability for any of the following:
a. Your personal information is disclosed according to law or upon request of a governmental authority;
b. Your personal information is disclosed due to server problems brought about by hacking, virus, or government action;
c. We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time and change the update date accordingly."</string>
