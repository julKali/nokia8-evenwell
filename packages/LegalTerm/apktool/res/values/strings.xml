Miscellaneous&lt;/b> &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>20.1 Choice of Law&lt;/b> &lt;br/> &lt;br/>The Terms are governed by the laws of Finland without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>20.2 Validity&lt;/b> &lt;br/> &lt;br/>The Terms neither exclude nor limit any of your mandatory rights in your country of residence that cannot by law be waived. If a provision of the Terms is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions will not be affected and the invalid provision will be replaced with a valid provision that comes closest to the result and purpose of the Terms. In the event one or more provisions of these Terms are not relevant to your use of the Service, it shall not impact the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Terms or the Terms as a whole. If there is any conflict between these HMD Global Service Terms and the Privacy Policy, the provisions of these HMD Global Service Terms prevail. The provisions of the Terms that are intended to survive termination of your registration remain valid after termination. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>&lt;b>20.3 Changes in Terms&lt;/b> &lt;br/> &lt;br/>HMD Global may modify the Terms at any time without prior notice.
